As the Data Scientist for Target Online Store my main objective of the proposed research is to provide insights for target advertisements team to improve their online sales which is relatively a new platform. Target advertisements might help to increase the online sales as it focuses on the behavioural, attitude and demographical features of the customer.

Target Corporation is the eighth-largest retailer in US.[source:wikipedia]. Target currently has 40 distribution centres across the United States alone through which they cater to their needs of stores and online purchases made by customer. Similarly, they have many centres across the world. It is therefore required to have an efficient stocking, especially in online sales, of materials as stocking incurs additional cost. Target advertisment is the best method to cope up with this, as it will help us to give customers with suggestions that they are most likely to buy. It will increase the sales without having to stock on items seldom sold.

The dataset provided with has information about items(description), stock code, customerID, quantity purchased for each item and unit price along with other minor informations. The objective of the research will be achieved by the method of clustering. Different types of clustering will be performed to optimize the study.By end of this study, if a new product is added to the stock, a prediction on how frequently it will be purchased by a customer can be inferred.
